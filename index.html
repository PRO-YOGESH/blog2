      <h2>  Joker (2019)</h2>
      <p id="dc">

Director Todd Phillips' Joker centers around the iconic arch nemesis and is an original, standalone fictional story not seen before on the big screen. Phillips’ exploration of Arthur Fleck, who is indelibly portrayed by Joaquin Phoenix, is of a man struggling to find his way in Gotham’s fractured society. A clown-for-hire by day, he aspires to be a stand-up comic at night…but finds the joke always seems to be on him. Caught in a cyclical existence between apathy and cruelty, Arthur makes one bad decision that brings about a chain reaction of escalating events in this gritty character study.

Three-time Oscar nominee Phoenix (The Master, Walk the Line, Gladiator) stars in the titular role alongside Oscar winner Robert De Niro (Raging Bull, The Godfather: Part II) as Franklin. The film also stars Zazie Beetz (Deadpool 2), Frances Conroy (TV’s American Horror Story, Hulu’s Castle Rock), Marc Maron (TV’s Maron, GLOW), Bill Camp (Red Sparrow, Molly’s Game), Glenn Fleshler (TV’s Billions, Barry), Shea Whigham (First Man, Kong: Skull Island), Brett Cullen (42, Netflix’s Narcos), Douglas Hodge (Red Sparrow, TV’s Penny Dreadful) and Josh Pais (upcoming Motherless Brooklyn, Going in Style).

Oscar nominee Phillips (Borat, The Hangover trilogy) directs from a screenplay he co-wrote with Oscar-nominated writer Scott Silver (The Fighter), based on characters from DC. The film is produced by Phillips and Oscar nominee Bradley Cooper (A Star Is Born, American Sniper) under their Joint Effort banner, and Oscar nominee Emma Tillinger Koskoff (The Wolf of Wall Street). It is executive produced by Michael E. Uslan, Walter Hamada, Aaron L. Gilbert, Joseph Garner, Richard Baratta, and Bruce Berman.

  <p id="about">★Between 2014 and 2015, Joaquin Phoenix was interested in acting in a low-budget "character study"-type film about a comic book villain like the Joker.
★Phoenix had previously declined to act in the Marvel Cinematic Universe because he would have been required to play the roles he was offered, like the Hulk and Doctor Strange, in multiple films
★He did not believe his idea for a film should cover the DC Comics character Joker, however, as he believed that character had been depicted in a similar way before, and tried to think of a different one. Phoenix's agent suggested setting up a meeting with Warner Bros., but he declined
★By September 2017, Warner Bros. was considering casting Leonardo DiCaprio as the Joker, hoping to use his frequent collaborator Scorsese's involvement to lure him, but by February 2018, Phoenix was Phillips' top choice for the role
